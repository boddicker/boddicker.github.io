The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity. Usually, growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety.

Hi,

skill.Build is a record of my thoughts, pursuits, and interests. I'll write about poker, coding, coffee, minimalism, travel, and other stuff.  

This site was built with Jekyll, a static-site generator. Thanks to John Otander for creating the [theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) powering the site.

Reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boddicker), through the [Contact](http://skill.build/contact) page, or in the comments.
