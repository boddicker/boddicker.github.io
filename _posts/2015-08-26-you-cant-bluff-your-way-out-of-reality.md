title: You Can't Bluff Your Way Out Of Reality
description: How to deal with boredom and lack of momentum in live poker games. 
---

Live poker has unavoidable spells of total boredom. Multitabling online, there is rarely a span of time where opportunity is not present. Live poker moves by at a snail's pace by comparison. The hopelessness of your holdings are bound to strike you with their dull, slow thud for an hour or two every session. These spells happen. There is good momentum. There is average momentum. There is no momentum. 

If you're not prepared for it, the restless feeling of non-momentum can get to you, with each unplayable hand piling onto the desperation. Many players can't handle what feels like eternal restraint, pulling the trigger where they should not, donating money when a fold was in order. They struggle not to drown in the hopelessness of the moment, swimming against the current, exhausting their air supply, bound to their seat. It is usually better to hold your breath...and wait. 

Your cards aren't in your control, but you alone control your reaction to the cards.  

What are you afraid of? Is unplayability part of the game, or a form of brutality threatening your existence?  How well do you deal with hardship? Do you accept it? or try to flounder out of what is real? 

Your image is fluid. It is not chained to this moment. Your ego should not be chained to the moment either. You are not the moment. You are in the moment. If you fight against the moment, you are fighting against the truth. 

Let your opponents underestimate your play after two hours of inaction. Exploit their misperceptions. Their opinion will evolve as soon as your holdings change. Images are malleable, so what benefit exists in playing trash hands out of sheer boredom? 

After mounting inaction some live players (maybe even most) get the notion to "open up" and "give action". So, they limp-call J5s from the UTG for no particular reason, or they open QTo in MP. Unpredictability is good, but unpredictability arising from irritability, not strategic thought, is a recipe for donation. 

These struggling players underestimate the fluidity of their image from moment-to-moment, exposing themselves to pointless risk. They invite permanent loss into their lives for unsound reasons related to their non-permanent image. They feel limited by their cards, and they are, yet they don't accept it. So they do stupid things. But you can't force reality to be anything but what it is. Your cards are your cards. Reality *is* and you *usually* can't bluff your way out of it.
