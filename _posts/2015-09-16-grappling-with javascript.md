title: Grappling With JavaScript
description: The key to learning JavaScript is persistence and loving the struggle.

The more I wrap my head around JavaScript, the more confident I become that whatever I'm learning will eventually seep in. How could it not? I'm here aren't I? Sure, this concept may seem abstract now. But, as long as I'm willing to bang my head against the wall, figuratively speaking, and feel stupid momentarily, I'm convinced things will work out. I bask in my ignorance because I know it's only temporary. 

Education can feel like a struggle. As long as I'm struggling intelligently, and understanding is reasonably within reach, that is the antithesis of staganation. I know that whatever I'm confronting now is progress and contributes to my growth as a human being. If I absorb nothing, at least I tried and can go about it better next time. Just as it can be hard to tell who is winning a close fight, hard won knowledge is often felt after the fact, after the battle. Learning to relish and love the challenge of learning is the surest way to return to the well.

I only have to show up, not once, but continually, and enjoy the process of humbling myself before the mountain of the unknown. If I'm *willing to learn*, my understanding will rise. I won't regress. What was once difficult to even absorb is now real and explainable--because I showed up. I just have to stay here, focused and patient and confident that with persistence, with daily effort, comes sure knowledge.
