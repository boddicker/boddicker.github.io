title: The Worst Kind of Thought
description: Unhelpful thoughts can hurt your productivity. 
---
 
A type of thought regularly assails my focus, innocently surfacing as a suggestion, a pleading reminder that I could be doing something else. What is more useless than this? I can only devote my *entire* attention to a *single* preoccupation. If my attention is suddenly intruded upon, that attention--once whole--fractures, with each competing fragment assigned a meager share of possible brain space.

Blips in consciousness that remind me of the vastness of the world aren't helpful. They shatter the present with a pang of useless longing. They take away from what I've set out to do by needlessly reminding me of all the things I can't be doing (because I can only be doing one thing at a time) before scattering off into the ether, dormant until the next interference. What's the point?

Procrastination is the point. These thoughts are your brain's attempt at procrastination, innocently outlining its case as a false ally, hoping to wriggle its way out of perceived pain by extending to us a list of other things we could be doing with our time. But our brain is not an indisputable friend guaranteed to steer us down a good path. Our brains, rife with biases and varying levels of glucose and sheer laziness, are as fallible as us. When we want to do something we know to be good, our brain may want to relax and do nothing. The brain will even try to foil us when it would be the direct beneficiary of the act we are to perform. I have a finite supply of energy, but I should rarely use that as an excuse for inaction. 

Before I run three miles tonight, my brain will inundate my attention with reminders of the other activities that await my action. Shouldn't you have coffee first? Don't you need to reply to your email? It would be more invigorating to run where the air is clean and cool, maybe you should fly to Nepal before you run? When is the last time you went on vacation?  

### Taming Procrastination

Just because more work exists does not mean there is any value in thinking about that work now, detracting from your present work. Before procrastination is able to fulfill its end by convincing us to do less important or altogether unimportant tasks, it must first offer us a menu of these less taxing alternatives. The key to taming procrastination is to notice when this menu is presented. Recognizing the first instance of procrastinatory thought, the thought to do something else or be somewhere else, will remove the influence these thoughts hold over our own actions.   

The ability to recognize certain thoughts for what they are can be like having a superpower. Instead of your brain conning you into doing something less valuable with your finite time, you'll recognize what your brain is up to. You won't see a helpful menu of substitute tasks. You'll see an array of misleading distractions.

Before you listen to your brain, question its motives. Deep down, procrastination is the impulse to avoid pain. We can perceive some tasks, even the tasks we need to act on, as painful. Thoughts can be destructive if you allow them to dissuade you from important work. If you take notice, you can end the toll procrastination has on your life.
